    <p>First of all, you need to decide the colour scheme of your rice. In this example I'm going to show you a rice
        for the neon theme. Download an HD wallpaper of your scheme</p>

    <p>
        Now when you have the wallpaper of your scheme, you need to get the icons of that theme. For this neon rice
        I am using the Candy Icons.

        <a href="https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1305251/" target="_blank">Candy Icons</a>
    </div>

    <p>
        After getting the icons, you have to get the cursor of your scheme.

    </div>

    <p>
        Now when you have wallpaper, icons and cursor, you need to install a dock and remove the xfce panel. You can
        follow the link give below to install Plank dock on Linux Mint.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
        After getting the dock, you should get a nice font for your system. Choose the one you like from the link
        below.

    </div>

    <p>
        You are done! You have successfully rice the Xfce desktop environment. Make sure to experiment with
        different wallpapers, icons, etc. Send your rice on my discord server! :)
