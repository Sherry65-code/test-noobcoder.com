        In this article you are going to learn all you need to know about desktop environments on Linux. So what is
        a desktop environment? A desktop environment decides how your desktop and gui looks. There are many
        different desktop environments on Linux. The one which comes pre-installed with Linux Mint is the Cinnamon
        desktop environment which is similar to window's GUI.

        KDE Plasma is a desktop environment which is both fast and good-looking. If you want a desktop environment
        which looks good and is as well as fast, go with KDE Plasma.

        Xfce is the most lightweight desktop environment. If you have a low-end machine, xfce might be the best
        option for you. Xfce doesn't look great by default, but you can customize it and make it look very great. As
        you can see the image below.

        GNOME is a popular desktop environment known for its looks. By default, it is one of the best looking
        desktop environments. But when there is an advantage, there is also a disadvantage. It uses resources very
        much which can be a problem if you do not have a decent machine. If you have a good machine then you can
        definitely go with GNOME, but if you do not have then it might be slow for you.

        Mate Desktop Environment is a user-friendly and lightweight desktop environment for Linux and Unix-like
        operating systems. It is a fork of the GNOME 2 desktop environment, which was discontinued in favor of GNOME
        3. If you want a user-friendly experience with customization then you can go with Mate.
