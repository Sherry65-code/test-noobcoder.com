        Congratulations on learning the complete basics of Linux! Thanks for following this course. If you get any
        problems then you can just look for them on forums and join my discord server for help. After you get
        comfortable with Linux command line and everything, you can switch your distribution to Endeavouros, Fedora
        or any other distribution you want. Have a great journey!
